# Football_Players
Being a huge fan of football for a huge chunk of my life, this task seemed too good to be true. I will be manipulating and visualing the data via exploratory data analysis in this football dataset which dates approximately back to the 2017/18 season. 

First we import the given libraries in our Jupyter Notebook Football_Players.ipynb and we load the dataset

Lets take a look at all the different clubs we have across the world in this dataset with the help of the unique function

We usually don't pronounce the full name of a club, for example: Olympique Lyonnais is better known as OL Lyon.

Now when we play FIFA, we tend to think about the top players so let's view the 20 best players in the world at the time
